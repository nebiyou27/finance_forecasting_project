# Finance Forecasting Project

## Overview
This project implements time series forecasting models for financial market analysis and portfolio optimization. It analyzes historical data for Tesla (TSLA), Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (BND), and S&P 500 ETF (SPY) to identify trends, predict future movements, and provide investment recommendations.

## Setup Instructions

### Environment Setup
1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv env
   ```

2. Activate the environment:
   - Windows: `env\Scripts\activate`
   - macOS/Linux: `source env/bin/activate`

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Data Collection
Run the data fetching script to download historical financial data:
```
python scripts/data_fetch.py
```

This will download data for TSLA, BND, and SPY from 2015-01-01 to 2025-01-31 and save it to a combined CSV file in the `data/raw` directory.

## Analysis Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the data for analysis
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualize trends, patterns, and relationships
3. **Feature Engineering**: Create relevant features for forecasting
4. **Model Development**: Implement time series forecasting models
5. **Model Evaluation**: Assess model performance and accuracy
6. **Portfolio Optimization**: Use forecasts to optimize investment portfolios

## Key Features

- Historical price analysis for TSLA, BND, and SPY
